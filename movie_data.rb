#This class is used to determine the popularity of a movie and the similarity
#between users using a text file from the current directory.
#Popularity is given by the formula (Average timestamp/ SCALEAVERAGETIMESTAMP) + number of ratings
#whether a movie has good or bad reviews, it could still be considered popular
#and a movie who is older (smaller timestamp) will usually have more ratings because 
#more people get a chance to rate it, so give a slight advantage to newer movies based on SCALEAVERAGETIMESTAMP.
#Similarity is given by 1 / 1 + ((rating of user1) - (rating of user2).abs))
